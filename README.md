# FocusBlock™ - Time management application
I did not find a good and simple time-blocking app in the Google Play Store, so I decided to make my own, which is minimalistic and simple enough. I personally don't like that mobile applications become distractions instead of tools to improve productivity, and this is the problem I try to fix with this project.

My initial goal is to develop core features and establish a solid codebase. Once this foundation is in place, I plan to expand FocusBlock™ into a comprehensive, cross-platform app with real-time data sync powered by Firebase or Supabase. The full version with cloud synchronization and cross-platform compatibility will be monetized through a monthly subscription.
