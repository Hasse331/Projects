# FocusBlockâ„¢ - Time management application
I did not find a good and simple time-blocking app in the Google Play Store or elsewhere, so I decided to make my own, which is minimalistic and simple enough. I personally don't like that mobile applications become distractions instead of tools to improve productivity, and this is the problem I try to fix with this project.

The goal is to make first base features and maintainable code structure, then optimize the application as a comprehensive cross-platform application with firebase/supabase backend with real-time data synchronizing. The full version of the application with cloud synchronizing and cross-platform features will be monetized based on a monthly SaaS subscription.
